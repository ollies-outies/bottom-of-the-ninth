    "It always feels good to go back to your old stomping grounds. Regardless of the circumstances."
    "I had a team now, or at least the bare bones needed to call it one. They hadn't met yet, but I knew they were gonna be flawless."
    "But then, the question remained: was I?"
    "I put this whole farce together because I am still grief-stricken for a life-altering fuckup I made."
    "Because I lost control, for just a second, and killed a man that I considered family."
    "I'm tired. I'm old. I'm angry, and sad, and I don't know if that'll be enough."

    "As I walked through, eventually making my way to the Gates, those words kept ringing in my ears. Will it be enough?"
    "The Hellgates had started appearing all over the Tri-kingdom area a few years ago. No one's quite sure why."
    "I had heard it was supposed to be a punishment for our sins. I'd also heard that the demons simply got bored, and wanted to see what topside looked like."
    "Either way, what it meant for professionals like me..."
    "Was new blood in the game."
    "The nearest HellGate wasn't far, just a few towns over. I got there a few days ahead of time to suss out the competition."
    "And who does that wonderful bitch that we know as Fate plop into my lap, right into my path?"

    "Why, none other than Ordog, the good-for-nothing reprobate who sold me the potion that made me lose control and kill my friend."
    "Now, as if this wasn't bad enough, whose glossy-eyed mortal soul was he training to be the next big Wizardball champion?"
    "Victor Sanhuana, former pro-star, killed by my own hand, and assumed unrevivable!"
    "See, an Arc of Death is a strong, and brutally effective move. But bodies can be brought back."
    "The Necromantic Clause of Aught Eight made sure of that."
    "But in the case that a body of a player is soulless, they are not to be revived. Ever."
    "As that is technically stealing the manager's current stake in the player."
    "Vic wasn't unrevivable. Arc of Death didn't destroy the soul, like the refs had called."
    "This Mother Fucker Had Stolen It!"
    "That's against the rules."
    "That's against the rules, and that's why I got kicked out."
    "That's against the rules, why I got kicked out, and now my friend's soul is enslaved in a flesh prison."
    "That's against the rules, why I got kicked out, my friend's soul, and... And he's a fucking asshole."

    c "Long time no see, you son of a bitch."
    "I spoke through gritted teeth, my hands aching to cast something at him. Arc of Death seemed pretty fitting."
    "But when he turned, he had a genuinely happy smile that caught me off guard."
    q "Ah! And you must be the coach of that new team we're up against. Ordog Soulflayer, coach of the Tophets. It's a pleasure to meet you, bud."
    "The bastard didn't remember me. I had to backpedal, and quickly."
    c "Yeah, you got me! We’re the Comedians, and I'm the head joker himself. How... are you?"
    "I don't remember what he told me. I was too busy fighting the urge to knock him dead where he stood."
    c "Oh, that's great. Hey, I came here to do a little wager."
    q "A wager? Ooh, I didn't know you were a betting man!"
    c "Yeah, well, there's a lotta stuff you don't know about me, huh."
    "I caught my tongue, before it decided to get me into any more trouble."
    c "But seriously. How would you like to make a bet? Soul for soul. I hear you underfolks are into souls."
    q "You caught me, I AM into souls."
    c "Well. If I win, how about... that soul there?"
    "I could barely point at V without trembling."
    q "Ooh, that's quite a prize. But what if I win?"
    "My pointed finger slowly turned into a thumb. Who's got a team fulla rookies and a snowball's chance in Hell?"
    c "This guy."
    c "I'll close my entire season, become your personal strategist."
    "Ordog laughed at me, for just a second, and then realized I wasn't laughing along."
    q "Oh, this one isn't a joke, is it."
    c "Nope."
    q "Then yes, I agree to these terms. If you win, the spirit's yours."
    q "No idea what you'd want him for, but hey, I'll take easy odds."
    c "Glad we're in agreement. Good luck, ''pal''."
    q "You too, funny human."

    "I made it about two blocks, before I lost my lunch. I had no idea what took me over when I said that. Living in Hell? That sounded like a... Well, a living Hell."
    "I guess that's where the saying came from, huh?"
    "But... there was something about seeing Vic like that. Lifeless is too on the nose." 
    "Enthralled might be another way of saying it."
    "He wasn't himself, that's for sure. If that were him still, he'd be fighting this tooth and nail."
    "But he wasn't. He was doing swinging drills, eyes fixed on the horizon... just a shell. A formidable, powerful pawn, to be used in whatever Ordog was planning." 
    "... But his plans still involved Victor, didn't they?"
    "His mood may've been different, but his actions... His actions were the same. Those swings still had the lean to the right he always had. His stance was still way too wide, just like when he was alive."
    "Coach used to say if he didn't shape up, it would bite him in the ass."
    "Well, consider that ass bitten."

    "The big day came, and I waited for my troops to fall in."
    "I had spent the day prior writing and rewriting a few thousand strategies for how to capitalize on Vic's weaknesses."
    "But I finally settled on five. Each one took a different focus, based on the strengths of the team."
    "I had them all in my back pocket when the team I'd gathered finally arrived."
  
    # DISPLAY FINAL TEAM SOMEHOW. SET VARIABLES? LOVE YOU THANK YOU.

    "I had to hand it to Fate. This group of rookies were looking like a professional squadron of mad mages."
    "We all gathered in the locker room, wherein I huddled them all for one last – and first - speech."
    c "Everyone, I've got a few things to say."
    c "I would like to say, first and foremost, how proud I am of all of you. For taking this step with me, and for taking this step in the first place. It's a dangerous road, but I'm sure that, together, we can be victorious!"
    "I struggled, saying that last word. If we lost, I wouldn't be. I would let all these people - these friends - down."
    "I considered telling them about the bargain. About the bet. But... I didn't want that on their minds, in what might be the biggest moment in their professional careers."
    c "No matter what happens out there, tonight, you already won. You've already advanced. You're nothing but champions, and I'm glad to be your coach."
    "They let out a cheer, but I hushed 'em down."
    c "That being said... I would actually prefer to win, truth be told."
    "They laughed. I wished I could've laughed along with 'em."
    c "Plus, I talked to the Tophet's coach. He thinks you're all just a buncha chumps."
    "A gasp."
    c "A buncha fools!"
    "A gasp, again."
    c "Just a buncha jokers, wasting his time!"
    c "But we ain't jokers. We're Comedians!"
    c "And the last laugh's gonna be on us, Gods damn it!!"
    "A cheer, louder than before." 
    c "Now. Here's the plan."
