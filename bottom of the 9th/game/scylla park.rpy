    cc “One of the factors that differentiates Wizardball from your average everyday bloodsport is the chaos… the fluidity of it all.”

    cc “And no one quite brings that chaos and fluidity like the player known simply as Scylla.”

    cc “No one truly knows just exactly how she broke into playing on the minor league circuit. Story goes she just showed up to the tryouts in front of everyone and wrote her name in on the team wall as if she had already been accepted.”

    cc “The manager was quite obviously confused and frustrated by this act, and so to prove herself, she challenged the entire team to a match of wizardball, against only her.”

    cc “She beat them 9-0 and to make a long story short, the manager was far less skeptical from that moment forward.”

    cc “Sadly, as with all great careers, something had to get in the way.”

    cc “Scylla would go on week-long drinking binges after matches, and once she started missing games because of it, she was let go from the team.”

     cc “I heard her voice from all the way across homefield.”

    cc “She was singing some sort of shanty. Or maybe it was a drinking song?”

“Let’s take all our heed, and not be too dumb- Theres plenty of time and plenty of rum!”:
sc “I’ll drink to that!”

    sc “Helps me feel… not so alone.”

    cc “Do you drink alone often?”

    sc “Only on days of the week that end in Y.”

    sc “Yeah... now that you mention it I pretty much exclusively drink alone.”

    cc “Seems a bit dreary, wouldn’t you agree?”

    sc “I would… but that would require me to admit to the fact that this is an unhealthy coping mechanism.”

    sc “One that leaves me in a deeper pit than I started in when I wasn’t liquored up yet.”

    cc “Honestly? Between you and me…”

    cc “Not incredibly sure I fully know why myself. Do you ever create a plan so complex and so foolproof that you are certain it must work out?"

    cc “But as time goes on the world throws more and more shit your way and that goal that felt so attainable just… crumbles?”

    sc “Buddy, I never make plans. If you don’t make plans, none of your plans can ever go wrong!”

    sc “A famous person said that, I think.”

    cc “Can’t believe I’m saying this but, you make a good point.”

    cc “Hey, I know you said feel lonely a lot of the time.”

    cc “I’m putting together a team, and I was curious if you’d wanna play on it.”

    sc “At this point that sounds pretty tempting, I won't lie. You really think we can pull a team together that has what it takes?”

    cc “The most honest answer I can give you is: who the hell knows?”

    sc “Now that’s what I like to hear. Put me down for a spot!”
