    c "They say curiosity killed the cat, but when it came to Dusk Darkness, curiosity made them more powerful than they ever could've imagined."
    c "Delving into the arts of necromancy at a very young age, Dusk soon became quite accustomed with all things dead, and mostly deadly."
    c "Necromancers were few and far between in the Wizardball minor league circuit, allowing Dusk to make a name for their feline self out on the field."
    c "Unfortunately, skills in dealing with the dead don't always translate into skills when dealing with the living."
    c "This was undoubtedly gonna be a tough one."
