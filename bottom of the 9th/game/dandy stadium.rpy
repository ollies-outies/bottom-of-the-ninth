    "Alouicious Dupris. ''Dandy'', to her fans. So, I called her Dandy."
    "Dandy was everything that made wizardball great, in it's hayday. A true sportswoman, she played fair, and always hit above the belt, so to say."
    "But as time went on, she went from classic to tacky. New rules were added, that she didn't play around. New magic was discovered, that she didn't learn."
    "New blood came into the game, and brought new skills and abilities, and she never adapted to it."
    "Fundamentals, she knew, but it was what the game brought with time that made people think she was stagnant."
    "Course, anyone who knew her would say that was a load of-"
    f "POPPYCOCK!"

    "I found her in the halls of the Katabas stadium, pounding on the bar of some conscession stand."
    f "NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIGHT WOULD SPEND THAT MUCH FOR A HOTTED DOG, BALLPARK OR NOT! WHY, I COULD BUY MY OWN MEAT GRINDER AND HOG ANUS FOR THAT PRICE!"
    "No one was at the stall, so it seemed she was just yelling for the sake of being loud."
    f "DO YOU COAT YOUR NACHOS IN GOLD? IS THAT WHY I'D HAVE TO TAKE OUT A MORGAGE TO BUY A BASKET?"
    f "WHAT ABSOLUTE HORSE HOCKY!!"
    "She knocked over a stack of large disposable cups, and started to stomp off."
    "She then turned around, restacked the cups as they were, then turned back to continue her huff."
    "Course, that's when she ran into me."
    f "Oh my- Casey Conrad? Is that you? I'd've heard you took one last dirt nap, and shimmied off this mortal coil! But, ha! In the flesh, more or less!"
    c "It's good to see you too, Dandy. You uh... looking to get some food?"
    "She turned back to the stand, ashamed."
    f "Well, ah, you see... I... How much did you see?"
    c "Just the tail end. Speaking of which, I had no idea you knew the going price of hog anus. I've got to say, I'm impressed."
    "She sighed, and made her way to a nearby bench, opposite from the stall. I took a seat next to her as she started."
    f "It's just... Well, it's hard to put into words without sounding too crotchety, I suppose."
    c "Go ahead, I won't judge."
    f "... This whole stadium's changed so much. The... trophies are so much bigger, now."
    "She looked like she was going to continue, but she stopped herself. We sat in companionable silence for a moment, my mind thinking back to when I was a kid."
    c "... This used to be a sideshow, right? This stall?"
    "She perked up when I mentioned it."
    f "Ah! Ah! Yes, yes it was! Full of, ''Antiquities and Curiosities''!"
    c "Right, right! When I was a kid, and I would watch games... Well, that was back when the game was still turn based, right? So, during those long charge rounds, I'd sneak out of the bleachers, and make my way down here."
    f "Truth be told, whelp, so did I. Whenever I was benchwarming, I'd try to mosey down here, and grab a candy floss."
    c "Oh, those were the best. And the uh... The Dancing Automaton? Was that was it was called?"
    f "You got it in one! You could feed it change, and it would cut a rug like nothing else."
    c "Didn't it gain sentience a few years in?"
    f "Joined the league, iffin I recall correctly. Played for the New Throughfare Candlestick-makers. Handguard."
    c "Right, right. Good times."
    "We were reduced back to silence, for a moment."
    f "... I'm getting old, C.C.. Far too old for my liking."
    f "I wouldn't mind the shakier joints, but it feels like everything else is getting younger."
    f "Shinier, sleaker. Better off. And, in a sentimental way, I'm proud. I'm happy, even."
    f "I just wish that I could still be a part of it."
    "She sat for a moment, gathering her thoughts again."
    f "I know I'm just a relic of a woman, now. Some novelty that people keep on their shelves, to oggle and gaze at, and to go ''How quaint!'' before moving on to the next curiosity."
    f "I guess, I'm just worried that the game's outgrown me, or I've outgrown the game. That my appeal'll stop, and I'll be replaced, by... by some..."
    "She gestures to the food stand."
    f "I don't want to be remembered as simply, what came before."
    "She quieted down again, staring at her feet. I needed to tell her something, that would hopefully knock her out of this funk."
