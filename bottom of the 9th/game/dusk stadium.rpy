    "They say curiosity killed the cat, but when it came to Dusk D'arcnes, curiosity made them more powerful than they ever could've imagined."
    "Delving into the arts of necromancy at a very young age, Dusk soon became quite accustomed with all things dead, and mostly deadly."
    "Necromancers were few and far between in the Wizardball minor league circuit, allowing Dusk to make a name for their feline self out on the field."
    "Unfortunately, skills in dealing with the dead don't always translate into skills when dealing with the living."
    "This was undoubtedly gonna be a tough one."

    c "What are you talking about?"
    w "The TEAM dummy! N'yi wanted to play n'yon n'yit from the moment n'you pitched n'yit to me."
    "I wasn't even mad. I laghed a little at the absurd awfulness of it and then asked..."
    c "If you already wanted to play, why did you act so opposed to it?"
    w "BECAUSE n'yi could tell n'you were down in the dumps n'yand needed n'ya little help to get n'yout n'yof that."
    "I racked my brain for some witty retort but in this moment I didn't need one. I just sighed and took my revalations in."
    c "Welcome to the team, Dusk"
    "I filled them in on the details, and after some promises of logo alterations and alternative forms of payment, namely corpses, they promised to meet me at the stadium."
