    "They say curiosity killed the cat, but when it came to Dusk D'arcnes, curiosity made them more powerful than they ever could've imagined."
    "Delving into the arts of necromancy at a very young age, Dusk soon became quite accustomed with all things dead, and mostly deadly."
    "Necromancers were few and far between in the Wizardball minor league circuit, allowing Dusk to make a name for their feline self out on the field."
    "Unfortunately, skills in dealing with the dead don't always translate into skills when dealing with the living."
    "This was undoubtedly gonna be a tough one."

    c "Okay but that aside, don't you miss the excitement of the game? The feeling of absolutely trampling the enemy team on your way to victory?"
    y "N'yi n'yam n'ya fan n'yof trampling... buuuut, n'yi've got a nap scheduled for the nexy week n'yand a half so N'yi don't think N'yi'll be able to play for you."
    c "At this point I'm not even suprised."
    y "N'yawwww, n'yif N'yi were n'yas washed n'yup n'yas n'you n'yi would feel the n'yexact same way!"

    y "N'yit's N'YOKAY! N'you don't need to make n'yexcuses for n'yorself."
    c "I don't even know why I'm here talking to you. You can call me all you want but I have a team and I'm gonna build it!"
    "I hopped the seats and started making my way across the field in a huff"
    "I'm not a washup. I'm on the rebound for gods sakes! That cat has no idea what they're talking about."
    "I don't need them on my team. I'm gonna make a whole-ass team and were gonna win a whole-ass wizardball game."
    "So why am I trying so hard to convince myself all this?"
    "I hadn't realized it until now, but I had stopped walking through the field halfway through the field."
    y "Hey n'yare you gonna move cause n'you're kinda getting n'yin the way n'yof the game."
    "There was still no game in sight."
    c "I really am just grasping at something I don't have am I?"
    y "N'yi mean thats one way of putting n'yit... but that's n'yot necisarily n'ya bad thing!"

    y "N'yi read that from the back n'yof a book someone threw n'yinto the garbage bin!"
    y "So... maybe n'owning n'yup to how n'you feel about n'yourself will help."

    y "What was that?"
    c "I'm a Washup!"
    y "N'yI can't hear you!"

    "I breathed a sigh of sweet relief after my outcry."
    c "Wow, you're right that was... cathardic."
    y "N'yi made n'yup my mind like 5 minuets n'yago by the way!"
    c "What are you talking about?"
    y "The TEAM dummy! N'yi wanted to play n'yon n'yit from the moment n'you pitched n'yit to me."
    "I wasn't even mad. I laghed a little at the absurd awfulness of it and then asked..."
    c "If you already wanted to play, why did you act so opposed to it?"
    y "BECAUSE n'yi could tell n'you were down in the dumps n'yand needed n'ya little help to get n'yout n'yof that."
    "I racked my brain for some witty retort but in this moment I didn't need one. I just sighed and took my revalations in."
    c "Welcome to the team, Dusk"
    "I filled them in on the details, and after some promises of logo alterations and alternative forms of payment, namely corpses, they promised to meet me at the stadium."
