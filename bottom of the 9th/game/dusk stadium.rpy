    c "They say curiosity killed the cat, but when it came to Dusk Darkness, curiosity made them more powerful than they ever could've imagined."

    c "Delving into the arts of necromancy at a very young age, Dusk soon became quite accustomed with all things dead, and mostly deadly."

    c "Necromancers were few and far between in the Wizardball minor league circuit, allowing Dusk to make a name for their feline self out on the field."

    c "Unfortunately, skills in dealing with the dead don't always translate into skills when dealing with the living."

    c "This was undoubtedly gonna be a tough one."

            du "N'yi couldn't give n'ya rat's n'yass what n'ya crowd thought n'yof me."


    c "That aside, don't you miss the excitement of the game? The feeling of absolutely trampling the enemy team on your way to victory.?"

    du "N'yi n'yam n'ya fan n'yof trampling… N'you know what? SIGN ME N'YUP"
