    "Market was a big hit, it turned out. Lots of friendly faces, lots of new pals."

    "But fate still had it in for me, ya see? So I let fate guide my footfalls, for a while."
    "Let my mind wander, and had my body following after it."
    "I thought about where I was now. How this whole thing was coming together."
    "The Comedians. That's what V always said he wanted his team to be called. I never got V, but he was a good friend."
    "Figured, I ought to pay respects, judging by what I did."
    "It still hurts to think about that day, just 5 years ago."
    "I was getting older, ya know. Not as spry and magic as I was in my prime."
    "See, even though Wizardball is named that, it only takes 1 spell to get you in."
    "Fire Ball. A classic, honestly."
    "So there were always players who knew the minimum, learned as a kid, and just used their wit and skill to make it through."
    "Powerful warriors, stealthy assassins... there were even some who tried to charm their way into wins."
    "But for me, it was all about the Spells."
    "I was a mastermind when it came to creative tactics. Was, I suppose, being the opperative word."
    "See, as I got older, my tactics still would work, just not with me. I couldn't keep up."
    "That's when I met Ordog."

    "A demon, notorious around the underworld circut. Purveyer of the best stimulants in the game."
    "And, as fate would have it, we shared a dinner table, after some victorious game."
    "He offered me a potion. Superior Mana, he called it. Said to boost your slots, and fill your meters, satisfaction Guarenteed."
    "And like a fool, I took it."
    "See, my issue wasn't needing to refill. My capacity was just getting lower."
    "So when my dumbass drank it..."
    "I surged."
    "Wizardball encourages stimulants. It's part of the fun, seeing just how crazy far you can take something."
    "They even encourage injury! There's a full staff of healers waiting by the sidelines, to rush to people who had their arms ripped off, or their guts spilled..."
    "Regeneration spells are amazing, and can fix almost anything."
    "But they can't fix permadeath."
    "After downing the pot, I turned to Victor. My teammate, Victor, who I had been through over 20 years of hardships with..."
    "And instead of a Fire Ball for a pass..."
    "A Finger of Death came out." 
    "No medics. No Greater Healing Touches."
    "Just the cold, departed body of my friend, and a game stuck in stalemate."
    "It was on this field. This same one."

    "And somehow, I keep getting pulled back here."
    "This is what I think fate's telling me. That's why I started the Commedians. To honor him, and to finally anchor me here. To live with what I did, and to move on."
    "I can't argue with where fate's guiding me. All I can do is adapt and thrive."
    "And in order to do that, I have to meet..."
