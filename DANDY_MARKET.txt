    cc “In her heyday she was a legend in the minor league. Watching her play was truly something else.”

    cc ”She lived and breathed classic Wizardball. But sadly, nothing stays classic forever.”

    cc “To put it simply, the game changed and she couldn't keep up with it. All these new strategies. Droves of new players that each brought new abilities and skills to the     table.”

    cc “She was a giraffe, and the tree branches grew too tall for her to reach, and her giraffe neck never grew quite tall enough to get to them as time went on."

    cc “Wait a minute what was I talking about?”

    cc “Dandy! I knew I wanted Dandy for my team...”
