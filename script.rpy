    "The years hadn't dulled the pain, but it had offered insight. Insight into what people were put here to do."
    "For some, they get busy living. For others, they caught dying."
    "How horrible, to be somewhere inbetween."

    "My name is Casey Conway Fisk. I'm a ex-professional ball player, living out in the boonies, in a little town called Katabas."

    "The name of the game was, and still is, Wizardball."
    "Everyone in the Trikingdom Area knows about it. Even some of the fools in the underworld know about it."
    "It's fast, unique, and has enough leniancy in the rules that anything and anyone can work."
    "Course, the few rules they have can't be broken, under any circumstances. Otherwise..."
    "Well, otherwise your sponsor's stop calling you, and you're forced to skip town, lay low for a while."
    "I was the biggest star the field's ever seen, ya know. The mighty C.C., up on the mound. Had my face on quite a number of breakfast foods."
    "But of course, the bigger you are, yada yada."
    "Maybe it's that desire to be big and important again, or maybe it's the nagging feeling in my heart, since I was asked to leave."
    "I still love the game, simply put. I love everything about it, from the feeling of dirt pulling at your feet, to the roar of the crowd, as someone lands a Fireball."
    "And as much as I tried, I couldn't live without it."
    "See, in those 5 years, I'd realized something. Something stronger than any one of us, something bigger."
    "Fate."
    "Fate's what brought me to the game in the first place. Fate's what put V in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Fate's the player, and we're all just pawns."
    "So... Why fight it?"
    "Fate'll bring what fate'll bring. All we can do is play with what's been given."

    "And, in this case, it's a pack of Coven brand ''Minor League's Up & Coming Rookie'' cards."
    "Complete, of course, with a stick of Gerblin Green Chewing Gum, which was as stale as a rock."
    "See, I couldn't play in the Major leagues. Board wouldn't let me. Still won't, in fact."
    "But I could gather a team."
    "Hand picked, by none other than the swaing hand of fate, I could amass a group of players that were never given the chance to go big, and finally let 'em."
    "I was done worrying about the fall. I was done letting what could happen prevent me from focusing on what has happened."
    "Let's see what fate had up first."
